This case study is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on estimating Earth's surface temperatures using interpolation and regression techniques based on historical data. The second part involves mathematical approximations using Taylor series expansions for trigonometric functions, illustrating fundamental concepts of numerical analysis.

*Part 1: Temperature Estimation Using Interpolation and Regression*

**Objectives:**

*1. Interpolation Analysis:*
- Estimate the Earth's surface temperature for even years (1982, 1984, etc.) between 1981 and 1999 using linear, quadratic, and cubic interpolation methods.
- Compare and contrast the results obtained from each interpolation method and explain the differences.

*2. Regression Analysis:*
- Apply a least-squares regression to estimate temperatures for even years based on the odd-year data provided.
- Analyze the results of the regression in comparison with the interpolation methods and explain any discrepancies based on theoretical foundations.

*3. Visualization:*
- Use Python to create a plot that shows the relationship between temperature and year, enhancing the understanding of the global temperature trend.

**Tools & Techniques:**
Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for interpolation, regression, and visualization.

*Part 2: Mathematical Approximation Using Taylor Series Expansion*

**Objectives:**

*1. Taylor Series Expansion:*
- Compute the fourth-order Taylor expansions for sin(x), cos(x), and sin(x)cos(x) around 0.
- Provide both manual calculations and Python scripts for each expansion.

*2. Application:*
- Approximate the value of cos(Ï€/4) using the fourth-order Taylor series expansion for cos(x).
- Determine the truncation error bound for the approximation, including either manual calculations or Python script to support the result.
